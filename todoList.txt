todo:
* subscriptionsService add an error check(if statment) that the user can't subscribe twice to the same movie (if needed).. figure out later
* react -  implement nested routing and private routing (later)
* react -  optimize components (for example i noticed that i fetch users in the main component, but in editUser i need to fetch user again, maybe i can get all the data beforehand and just pass a specific user instead of fetching it)
* react - optimize all components!!! there are some things that can be way more efficient!!! (fetching mainly)
